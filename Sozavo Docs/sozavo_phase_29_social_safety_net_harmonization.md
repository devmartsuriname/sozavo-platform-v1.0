# 1. Purpose of the Harmonization Plan
Phase 29 establishes the **national strategy for unifying all existing and future social programs** under a single, interoperable architecture.

Objectives:
- End fragmentation across ministries
- Establish one national architecture for social support
- Standardize eligibility, workflows, data definitions, and reporting
- Enable cross-program fraud detection & budget control
- Prepare Suriname for regional & international social protection standards

This plan is a **government-wide modernization blueprint**.

---

# 2. Current Fragmentation Overview (Baseline Assessment)
Suriname’s social support ecosystem is currently fragmented across:
- SoZaVo (general assistance, social benefits, child support)
- Ministry of Health (health subsidies, disability support)
- Ministry of Housing (rental subsidies, housing support)
- Ministry of Education (educational assistance)
- Ministry of Finance (indirect social support via taxation)
- NGOs & semi-government programs

Challenges:
- Duplicate beneficiaries
- Double-dipping across programs
- Manual verification between ministries
- Inconsistent eligibility criteria
- Lack of shared data formats
- Hard-to-audit processes

Phase 29 resolves these weaknesses.

---

# 3. Harmonization Vision (2030 Target)
By 2030, Suriname will operate a **National Social Safety Net (NSSN)** that is:
- **Unified** – All programs share common data sources & eligibility foundations
- **Transparent** – One national dashboard for Cabinet & policy teams
- **Efficient** – Shared verification flows (identity, income, household)
- **Fair** – Fraud and double-dipping reduced through cross-program checks
- **Accessible** – Citizens use one portal for all benefits
- **Adaptive** – New social programs plug into the same infrastructure

---

# 4. Harmonization Layers
The harmonization plan has **five structural layers**:

## 4.1 Layer 1 – Unified Citizen Identity & Household Data
All programs rely on:
- Central Citizen Record (CCR)
- National household registry
- Shared income verification (Subema)
- Shared demographic data (CBB)

## 4.2 Layer 2 – Shared Eligibility Framework
A national rule structure enabling:
- Cross-program income threshold alignment
- Shared definitions of vulnerability
- Shared validation logic for age, household, health, and employment

## 4.3 Layer 3 – Shared Digital Workflows
All programs use:
- Application wizard framework
- Document validation engine
- Eligibility engine
- Fraud detection engine
- Payment engine

## 4.4 Layer 4 – Unified Reporting & Analytics
The National Dashboard (Phase 25) expands to include all ministries.

## 4.5 Layer 5 – Unified Legal & Policy Governance
A shared legislative foundation enabling:
- Digital intake for all ministries
- Cross-data sharing
- Fraud investigation rights

---

# 5. Cross-Program Eligibility Harmonization
Define national standards for evaluating:
- Income limits
- Household vulnerability scoring
- Disability status verification
- Child dependency definitions
- Health & education conditions

Benefits:
- Eliminates contradictory eligibility rules
- Ensures fairness
- Enables AI risk modeling across programs

---

# 6. Inter-Ministry Data Integration Roadmap
Data exchange expands beyond Phase 23 to include:

## 6.1 Phase 1 – Core Data Providers
- Finance (income)
- Subema (employment)
- CBB (identity & households)
- Health (disability & child wellness)

## 6.2 Phase 2 – Secondary Programs
- Housing Ministry (rental subsidies)
- Education Ministry (student support)
- NGOs (food support, emergency support)

## 6.3 Phase 3 – National Data Lake (Long-Term)
A structured repository enabling:
- Research & analytics
- Poverty mapping
- Program performance insights

---

# 7. Harmonized Case Lifecycle Model
All programs follow the same lifecycle:
```
Intake → Verification → Eligibility → Review → Decision → Payment → Monitoring → Renewal
```
Ensures consistency across government operations.

---

# 8. Fraud Prevention Across Programs
Multilateral fraud detection includes:
- Shared identity mapping
- Cross-program duplicate detection
- Income mismatch alerts
- Household composition anomalies
- AI-based risk scoring across *all* social programs

Example Findings:
- Same household receiving benefits from 3+ programs unexpectedly
- Income reported differently across ministries
- Children fraudulently listed in multiple households

---

# 9. Financial Harmonization
Unified:
- Payment standards
- Bank file formats
- Audit logging
- Reconciliation workflows
- Financial forecasting

Enables Ministry of Finance to oversee **total social spending exposure**.

---

# 10. Citizen Experience Harmonization
Citizens see **one unified experience**:
- One login
- One application portal
- One document vault
- One notification center
- One status timeline for all benefits

All benefits appear together in the citizen dashboard.

---

# 11. Governance Structure for Harmonization
Governance expands to include:

## 11.1 National Social Safety Net Council (NSSNC)
Chaired by the Vice President.
Members:
- SoZaVo
- Finance
- Health
- Housing
- Education
- ABS
- Digital Governance Unit
- Devmart (technical advisory)

Responsibilities:
- Harmonization roadmap execution
- Rule alignment approvals
- Cross-program fraud oversight

## 11.2 Technical Harmonization Committee (THC)
Ensures:
- API alignment
- Data dictionary consistency
- Standardization of workflows

## 11.3 Operational Harmonization Group (OHG)
Ensures:
- Uniform processes across district offices
- Shared training programs

---

# 12. Harmonization Timeline (High-Level)
```
2025–2026  → SoZaVo internal harmonization (MVP + public portal)
2026–2027  → Finance + Health integration
2027–2028  → Housing + Education integration
2028–2029  → Full inter-ministry harmonization (NSSN live)
2029–2030  → Predictive ecosystem + national optimization
```

---

# 13. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Ministries unwilling to share data | High | Legal mandate + NSPIC enforcement |
| Conflicting eligibility rules | High | National Eligibility Framework |
| Technical integration delays | Medium | Dedicated inter-ministry integration teams |
| Data privacy concerns | High | Data minimization + strict RLS |
| Organizational resistance | Medium | Harmonized training programs |
